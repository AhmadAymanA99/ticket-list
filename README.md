# Getting Started with the Application

This README provides step-by-step instructions to get the application up and running. Follow these guidelines to set up the project and start the development server.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Yarn** package manager - [Installation Guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

To install all the required dependencies for the application, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
yarn install
```

This will download and set up all the necessary packages specified in the `package.json` file.

### 2. Start the Development Server

To start the application in development mode, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

This command will:

- Launch the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your default web browser.
- Automatically reload the page when changes are made to the source files.
- Display lint errors and other issues in the browser or terminal.

## Testing

The application includes a test suite to ensure its components and functionality work as expected.

### Run Tests

To run the test suite in interactive watch mode, use:

```bash
yarn test
```

This command will:

- Execute all available tests and display results in the terminal.
- Watch for changes in the code and automatically re-run tests.

For more information on testing, refer to the [Running Tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

## Building the Application

To build the application for production, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will:

- Bundle the application for production.
- Optimize the code for better performance.
- Generate a `build` folder containing the static files ready for deployment.

## Additional Notes

### Customization

If you need to customize the application configuration (e.g., webpack, Babel, or ESLint), you can eject the application by running:

```bash
yarn eject
```

**Note:** This is a one-way operation and cannot be undone. Proceed with caution.
